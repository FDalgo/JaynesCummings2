# JaynesCummings2
![](https://travis-ci.org/enzotarta/JaynesCummings2.svg?branch=master)

First of all I would like to thanks Jebej work (jebej/JaynesCummings.jl) who inspired this one.
The main purpose of this packet is to perform research around Jaynes-Cummings model and extensions like Rabi.
Unlike Jebej work, this uses a different formalism for both matrix representation of the hamiltonian and the density matrix.
Further, the used formalism and conventions is coherent with most of the works in literature.
The only external library here used is PyPlot and it is exclusively used to perform plots.
Some examples are available in the folder "examples/"
